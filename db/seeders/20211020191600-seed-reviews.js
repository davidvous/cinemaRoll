The creative and intelligent story is so well thought through, the excitement and tension is crazy good. The writers behind this plot is as genius as the smart minds described in the show. There is a perfect balance between high pace excitement and slow scenes. Neatly jumping between past and present, seamlessly connecting the dots. You constantly get surprised of how you think things are. You get to know a high number of interesting characters in depth, all amazingly well acted. You will for sure be glued to this show, wanting to know the end, but at the same time not wanting it to end.",
